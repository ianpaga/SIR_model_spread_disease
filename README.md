SIR model of the spread of a disease 
====

Description: The main program disease_spreading_traveling.m solves the coupled system of differential equations that govern the time evolution of the number of susceptible S, infected I, 
and recovered R people. My main objective is to predict how an infectious disease (like Covid-19, for instance) would spread in the Swedish cities of Lund, Malmo, and Helsinborg. 

Details on the SIR model can be found on the webpage of the MAA (Mathematics Association of America):
[The SIR model of the spread of disease](https://maa.org/press/periodicals/loci/joma/the-sir-model-for-spread-of-disease-the-differential-equation-model)

Note: This project was developed in 2017, two years before Covid-19.
